# GHC readthedocs hack

This is a quick hack for hosting GHC's Sphinx-based user guide on
[readthedocs](http://ghc.readthedocs.org/).

## Updating the documentation

Set the `GHC_TREE` environment variable to point to the root of a GHC source
tree. Run `./export.sh`. Create an appropriately named tag if desired (e.g.
`8.0.1`). Push.

'Tis all.
